The HED EEG Many Labs project is analyzing each of the datasets in EEG Many Labs project, which seeks to replicate key EEG studies. 
The HED project will produce the following information:

1. A pictorial timeline of the unfolding of events based on the description from the papers.
2. A proposed design for the event files that would be reported in BIDS format for these datasets.
3. A proposed HED tagging for the event files.

The goal of HED EEG Many Labs is to suggest an event organization and annotations that will ensure
that shared datasets provide complete and accurate metadata to support downstream analysis.

The first three datasets to be worked on in this effort are:

> Onton, J., Delorme, A., & Makeig, S. (2005). Frontal midline EEG dynamics during working memory. NeuroImage, 27(2), 341–356. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.04.014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.04.014). 

> Sergent, C., Baillet, S., & Dehaene, S. (2005). Timing of the brain events underlying access to consciousness during the attentional blink. Nature Neuroscience, 8(10), 1391–1400. [https://doi.org/10.1038/nn1549](https://doi.org/10.1038/nn1549).

> Hajcak, G., Holroyd, C. B., Moser, J. S., & Simons, R. F. (2005). Brain potentials associated with expected and unexpected good and bad outcomes. Psychophysiology, 42(2), 161–170. [https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.2005.00278.x](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.2005.00278.x).
